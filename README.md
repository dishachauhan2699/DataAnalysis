# DataAnalysis
Inspection, cleaning, combining on different datasets, to optimise them for future model implementation.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) **corrupt** or **inaccurate 
records** from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant
parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

## Combining Data
Joining and merging DataFrames is the core process to start with data analysis and machine learning tasks. 
It is one of the toolkits which every Data Analyst or Data Scientist should master because in almost all the cases data comes 
from multiple source and files. You may need to bring all the data in one place by some sort of join logic and then start your analysis.

## Summaries and Aggregation
Summaries are a special kind of formulas that are built into pandas to save you time and effort. They can be used to 
generate aggregations for your data using aggregate functions such as Count, Average, Sum, and Standard Deviation. Summaries work 
based on how our data is grouped.
